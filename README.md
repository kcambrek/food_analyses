This repository contains several text analyses excercises and experiments on online recipes.

The chef.py has a simple interface which allows you to explore the relations between different ingredients based on 250,000 online recipes from https://www.allrecipes.com .

For example, the following image shows how "parsley" and "shrimp" are related:
